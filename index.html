<p>•       Provide a button in the pixel inspector tool that copies the current pixel information to the paint brush tool as the color chosen for painting.</p>

<p>•       Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the brush.</p>

<p>•       Modify the paint brush tool to allow the "opacity" of the paint to be controlled. Let opacity be determined as a percentage between 0 and 100 which controls the blending of the paint brush color and the existing color of the pixels being painted.</p>

<p>•       Add a new "blur" tool that acts like a paint brush but instead of painting a color it blurs an area of the picture. Include controls for determining the blur area size.</p>

<p>•      Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the Saturation of image from -100 to 100.</p>

<p>•      Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the bBrightness of image from -100 to 100.</p>

<p>• Captain and lead developer of team BlueCrew. Designed and developed the application on IOS platform. The front-end part used IBMBluemix(PaaS), BKON-SDK and Cocoa Touch frameworks. </p>

<p>• Developed a function using MVC and Observer and delegate design pattern which checks the location of a Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) iBeacon, in our case a BKON A1 device, with a 30m circle. </p>

<p>• Implemented a feature, which automatically upload the BKON device’s parameters to IBM cloud   service, using MySQL database service on cloud serve to track the device that conform to the user’s requirements. </p>

<p>From(<a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html">https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html</a>). When running the "pod install" command, the following error is returned:</p>

<p>[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMBluemix, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMBluemix', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMBluemix.</p>

<p>However, running pod update IBMBluemix results in:</p>

<p>[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMFileSync, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMFileSync', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMFileSync.</p>

<p>and trying pod update IBMFileSync results in it looping back to the error about updating IBMBluemix pod.</p>

<p>It seems the latest update to Cocoapods is causing this issue. I was forced to revert to an earlier version to allow the dependencies to install correctly.</p>

<p>If you have the latest version installed you will have to call:</p>

<pre><code> [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods
</code></pre>

<p>I was forced to uninstall the other gems as well:</p>

<pre><code> [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-core
 [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-downloader  
 [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-plugins
 [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-trunk
 [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-try
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can install any version below 0.35.0. I used 0.33.1 but 0.34 is supported as well:</p>

<pre><code> [sudo] gem install cocoapods -v 0.33.1
</code></pre>

<p>After done the previous steps, the Bluemix mobile data service SDK should be work.</p>

<p>There are three tools.
Run PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already
one there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that
pixel</p>

<p>Run ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can
make chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and
brightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s
to finish</p>

<p>The most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo
in there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which
is next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block</p>

<a id="photo-brush-tool" class="anchor" href="#photo-brush-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Photo Brush tool</h1>

<p>open ImageEditor.java, you can enter your photo link in
readFromURL(“”).</p>

<p>There are three tools.
Pixel Inspector: choose and click anywhere on photo, print the RGB of that pixel, then you can use set paintBrush Color tool
Print Brush: make your chose, then click or pull anywhere on photo
Blur Brush:same as print brush</p>

<p>download the file and touch the screen, it's a small ios game. Please leave your commit. Created by Object-C</p>

<p>There a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.</p>

<p>Really thank you for your time</p>
