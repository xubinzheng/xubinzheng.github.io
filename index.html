<p>Add the Mobile Cloud Services SDK to your iOS app
The SDK contains the client code to access all of the mobile services. Both SDKs are subject to the license agreement contained within the archive.</p>

<p>Install the SDK and dependencies with CocoaPods. From the folder where you have downloaded your sample, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ pod install
</code></pre>

<p>But I really suggest if someone want to install the SKD, use the following command firstly instead previous one</p>

<pre><code>$ pod update
</code></pre>

<p>Because sometimes due to the previous naive CocoaPods resolver, someone were using a pre-release version of 'IBMBluemix', without explicity asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. So use this command to check firstly will be really helpful.</p>

<a id="imageadjuster-and-puzzle-application" class="anchor" href="#imageadjuster-and-puzzle-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ImageAdjuster and Puzzle application</h3>

<p>There are three tools.
Run PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already
one there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that
pixel</p>

<p>Run ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can
make chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and
brightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s
to finish</p>

<p>The most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo
in there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which
is next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block</p>

<pre><code>first the frozen of imageAdjuster
second can't change the image in puzzle and the random the small block
</code></pre>

<a id="photo-brush-tool" class="anchor" href="#photo-brush-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Photo Brush tool</h3>

readFromURL(“”).</p>

<p>There are three tools.

<p>There a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.</p>

<p>Really thank you for your time</p>
