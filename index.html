<a name="imageadjuster-and-puzzle-application" class="anchor" href="#imageadjuster-and-puzzle-application"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ImageAdjuster and Puzzle application</h3>

<p>There are three tools.
Run PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already
one there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that
pixel</p>

<p>Run ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can
make chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and
brightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s
to finish</p>

<p>The most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo
in there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which
is next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block</p>

<pre><code>first the frozen of imageAdjuster
second can't change the image in puzzle and the random the small block
</code></pre>

<a name="photo-brush-tool" class="anchor" href="#photo-brush-tool"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Photo Brush tool</h3>

<p>There are three tools.

Print Brush: make your chose, then click or pull anywhere on photo

<p>There a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.</p>

<p>Really thank you for your time</p>
