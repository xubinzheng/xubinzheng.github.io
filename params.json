But also some stuff on SAS, MATLAB and GAMS. \r\n\r\nThere are photo editor, image adjuster, image puzzle game, external sorting and linked list created by JAVA.\r\nAnd some small ios game created by Swift.\r\n\r\nGo to my Github and clone anything you need but at the same time please add a commit and let me know if you have any question.\r\n\r\n#IBM IOT design project\r\n###This is a High-Value Asset Tracking software using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon\r\n####Solving:\r\nTracking assets in a hospital environment where the location history of all patients and important assets are monitored and stored in order to lower costs and improve quality of patient care\r\n####Please check more information @ xubinzheng.github.io/BlueCrew\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xubinzheng/BlueCrew/master/Gif/BKondemo.gif\"/>\r\n\r\n#IBM BlueMix mobile data IOS SDK \"pod install\" error solution \r\n\r\nFrom(https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html). When running the \"pod install\" command, the following error is returned:\r\n\r\n[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMBluemix, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMBluemix', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMBluemix.\r\n\r\nHowever, running pod update IBMBluemix results in:\r\n\r\n[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMFileSync, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMFileSync', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMFileSync.\r\n\r\nand trying pod update IBMFileSync results in it looping back to the error about updating IBMBluemix pod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems the latest update to Cocoapods is causing this issue. I was forced to revert to an earlier version to allow the dependencies to install correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you have the latest version installed you will have to call:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods\r\n```\r\nI was forced to uninstall the other gems as well:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-core\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-downloader  \r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-plugins\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-trunk\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-try\r\n```\r\nThen you can install any version below 0.35.0. I used 0.33.1 but 0.34 is supported as well:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem install cocoapods -v 0.33.1\r\n```\r\nAfter done the previous steps, the Bluemix mobile data service SDK should be work.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# ImageAdjuster and Puzzle application\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nRun PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already\r\none there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that\r\npixel\r\n\r\nRun ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can\r\nmake chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and\r\nbrightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s\r\nto finish\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo\r\nin there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which\r\nis next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block\r\n\r\n```\r\nfirst the frozen of imageAdjuster\r\nsecond can't change the image in puzzle and the random the small block\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Photo Brush tool\r\nopen ImageEditor.java, you can enter your photo link in\r\nreadFromURL(“”).\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nPixel Inspector: choose and click anywhere on photo, print the RGB of that pixel, then you can use set paintBrush Color tool\r\nPrint Brush: make your chose, then click or pull anywhere on photo\r\nBlur Brush:same as print brush\r\n\r\n#KickNinja\r\ndownload the file and touch the screen, it's a small ios game. Please leave your commit. Created by Object-C\r\n\r\n\r\n# KickElizabeth\r\n\r\nThere a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.\r\n\r\nReally thank you for your time\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
