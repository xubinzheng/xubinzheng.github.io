When I was in hospital, I noticed that the nurse had to look for the sphygmomanometer in another room. This prompted me to wonder if I could locate the sphygmomanometer through software to save the trouble of looking for the sphygmomanometer. \r\n\r\n•        With this idea in mind, I initiated an IBM IOT project as soon as I was discharged from hospital. By cooperating with the corresponding hardware, I designed software that could track high-value medical equipment. In this way, the wait time of patients can be shortened significantly and it can also bring convenience to nurses or doctors. \r\n\r\n•\tCaptain and lead developer of team BlueCrew. Designed and developed the application for IOS platform on XCode development environment. The front-end part involving IBMBluemix(PaaS), CoreBluetooth and Cocoa Touch frameworks. The main feature, which automatically searches the nearby Bluetooth(BLE) device, involving MVC, Observer and Delegate design pattern. \r\n\r\n•\tImplemented a function, which automatically uploads the BKON device’s data to IBM cloud   service, using MySQL database service on cloud to track the device.

Let opacity be determined as a percentage between 0 and 100 which controls the blending of the paint brush color and the existing color of the pixels being painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n•       Add a new \"blur\" tool that acts like a paint brush but instead of painting a color it blurs an area of the picture. Include controls for determining the blur area size.\r\n\r\n(https://github.com/xubinzheng/photo_brush)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xubinzheng/photo_brush/master/demo/demo.png\" width = \"320\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n####ImageAdjuster_and_Puzzle, Fall 2013\r\n•      Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the brush factor from 1 to 5.\r\n\r\n•      Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the Saturation of image from -100 to 100.\r\n\r\n•      Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the bBrightness of image from -100 to 100.\r\n\r\n•      The puzzle: click the block and have fun\r\n(https://github.com/xubinzheng/ImageAdjuster_and_Puzzle)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xubinzheng/ImageAdjuster_and_Puzzle/master/demo/after.png\" width = \"320\"/>\r\n\r\n####Minecraft Mod “LambdaCraft” Development, Winter 2014\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and developed the Mod “LambdaCraft” for game Minecraft which was written in Java, using Forge API and CraftBukkit plugin on Eclipse IDE.

Designed and developed the application on IOS platform. The front-end part used IBMBluemix(PaaS), BKON-SDK and Cocoa Touch frameworks. \r\n\r\n•\tDeveloped a function using MVC and Observer and delegate design pattern which checks the location of a Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) iBeacon, in our case a BKON A1 device, with a 30m circle. \r\n\r\n•\tImplemented a feature, which automatically upload the BKON device’s parameters to IBM cloud   service, using MySQL database service on cloud serve to track the device that conform to the user’s requirements. \r\n\r\n\r\n#IBM BlueMix mobile data IOS SDK \"pod install\" error solution \r\n\r\nFrom(https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html). When running the \"pod install\" command, the following error is returned:\r\n\r\n[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMBluemix, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMBluemix', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMBluemix.\r\n\r\nHowever, running pod update IBMBluemix results in:\r\n\r\n[!] Due to the previous naïve CocoaPods resolver, you were using a pre-release version of IBMFileSync, without explicitly asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. Please decide to either use that pre-release version by adding the version requirement to your Podfile (e.g. pod 'IBMFileSync', '= 1.0.0.20140707-1250') or revert to a stable version by running pod update IBMFileSync.\r\n\r\nand trying pod update IBMFileSync results in it looping back to the error about updating IBMBluemix pod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems the latest update to Cocoapods is causing this issue. I was forced to revert to an earlier version to allow the dependencies to install correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you have the latest version installed you will have to call:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods\r\n```\r\nI was forced to uninstall the other gems as well:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-core\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-downloader  \r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-plugins\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-trunk\r\n [sudo] gem uninstall cocoapods-try\r\n```\r\nThen you can install any version below 0.35.0. I used 0.33.1 but 0.34 is supported as well:\r\n```\r\n [sudo] gem install cocoapods -v 0.33.1\r\n```\r\nAfter done the previous steps, the Bluemix mobile data service SDK should be work.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#IOS SpriteKit game “FlappyRect”\r\n\r\n•\tDesigned and developed the game “FlappyRect” refers FlappyBird on IOS platform for fun.\r\n\r\n•\tUsing SpriteKit and UIKit frameworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# ImageAdjuster and Puzzle application\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nRun PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already\r\none there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that\r\npixel\r\n\r\nRun ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can\r\nmake chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and\r\nbrightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s\r\nto finish\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo\r\nin there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which\r\nis next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block\r\n\r\n\r\n# Photo Brush tool\r\nopen ImageEditor.java, you can enter your photo link in\r\nreadFromURL(“”).\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nPixel Inspector: choose and click anywhere on photo, print the RGB of that pixel, then you can use set paintBrush Color tool\r\nPrint Brush: make your chose, then click or pull anywhere on photo\r\nBlur Brush:same as print brush\r\n\r\n#KickNinja\r\ndownload the file and touch the screen, it's a small ios game. Please leave your commit. Created by Object-C\r\n\r\n\r\n# KickElizabeth\r\n\r\nThere a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.\r\n\r\nReally thank you for your time\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
