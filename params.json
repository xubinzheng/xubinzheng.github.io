{"name":"Xubinzheng.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Xubin's GitHub Pages.\r\nThis page will show all of my projects. Including JAVA, SWIFT and Object-C language. But also some stuff on SAS, MATLAB and GAMS. \r\n\r\nThere are photo editor, image adjuster, image puzzle game, external sorting and linked list created by JAVA.\r\nAnd some small ios game created by Swift.\r\n\r\nGo to my Github and clone anything you need but at the same time please add a commit and let me know if you have any question.\r\n\r\n#Our IBM IOT design project\r\nPlease check more information @ xubinzheng.github.io/BlueCrew\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xubinzheng/BlueCrew/master/Gif/BKondemo.gif\"/>\r\n\r\n###I just found something wrong about SDK IOS starter.\r\n\r\nAdd the Mobile Cloud Services SDK to your iOS app\r\nThe SDK contains the client code to access all of the mobile services. Both SDKs are subject to the license agreement contained within the archive.\r\n\r\nInstall the SDK and dependencies with CocoaPods. From the folder where you have downloaded your sample, run the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ pod install\r\n```\r\nBut I really suggest if someone want to install the SKD, use the following command firstly instead previous one\r\n```\r\n$ pod update\r\n```\r\nBecause sometimes due to the previous naive CocoaPods resolver, someone were using a pre-release version of 'IBMBluemix', without explicity asking for a pre-release version, which now leads to a conflict. So use this command to check firstly will be really helpful.\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/ios/ios.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###README is a summary and a guide of each project, please read them careful. And some project may need your help to be better.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ImageAdjuster and Puzzle application\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nRun PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already\r\none there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that\r\npixel\r\n\r\nRun ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can\r\nmake chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and\r\nbrightness change. But it’s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s\r\nto finish\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo\r\nin there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which\r\nis next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block\r\n\r\n```\r\nfirst the frozen of imageAdjuster\r\nsecond can't change the image in puzzle and the random the small block\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Photo Brush tool\r\nopen ImageEditor.java, you can enter your photo link in\r\nreadFromURL(“”).\r\n\r\nThere are three tools.\r\nPixel Inspector: choose and click anywhere on photo, print the RGB of that pixel, then you can use set paintBrush Color tool\r\nPrint Brush: make your chose, then click or pull anywhere on photo\r\nBlur Brush:same as print brush\r\n\r\n###KickNinja\r\ndownload the file and touch the screen, it's a small ios game. Please leave your commit. Created by Object-C\r\n\r\n\r\n### KickElizabeth\r\n\r\nThere a problem I hope you can help me to solve it. I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works. If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped. Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.\r\n\r\nReally thank you for your time\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
